# Keypad_doorLock_SecuritySystem
This is an arduino project, I made a keypad door lock security system using two arduinos. These arduinos communicate with each other using I2c Interface. 
For this project you need three libraries
1. Wire Library, it is pre-installed in Arduino IDE. 
2. Liquid Crystal library, it is also pre-installed. But this library is only use for Parallel interface LCD. For i2c interface you need to install some other library. 
3. Keypad library, by Mark Stanley, Alexander Brevig. You can download if from library manager or Github: https://github.com/Chris--A/Keypad

Here I have also used a push button, to open/close door from inside the house. 
For to clear the screen press '#'
and to lock the door you can press any 6 digit key. 

Let me know, if you having any difficuty to understad the logic or circuit and also if any improvement in code.
